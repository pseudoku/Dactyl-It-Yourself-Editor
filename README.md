# Dactyl-It-Yourself-Editor

OpenSCAD implementation of Dactyl-like keyboard
No clojure because I'm allergic to java
Motivation: Rapid generation and prototyping of layouts and somewhat readable generators

Prerequisites: Ensure you have the openscad fork of scad-utils https://github.com/openscad/scad-utils and skin/sweep from https://github.com/openscad/list-comprehension-demos installed in your OpenSCAD/libraries folder

1. Open Editor
2. Modify Parameter in Layouts
3. A lot of other bullshits
4. Render Top Plate
5. Render Bottom Plate
6. Iterate to your heart's content!
